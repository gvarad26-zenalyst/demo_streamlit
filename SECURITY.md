### 1. **Environment Variables**
- [ ] Created `config.env` from `config.env.example`
- [ ] Set unique, strong AWS credentials
- [ ] Configured secure API server URL
- [ ] Set appropriate S3 bucket permissions
- [ ] **NEVER committed `config.env` to version control**

### 2. **AWS Security**
- [ ] Created dedicated IAM user for this application
- [ ] Applied principle of least privilege
- [ ] Enabled MFA on AWS account
- [ ] Rotated access keys regularly
- [ ] Limited S3 bucket access to necessary operations only

### 3. **API Security**
- [ ] API server runs on HTTPS
- [ ] Implemented proper authentication
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] CORS properly configured

### 4. **Application Security**
- [ ] Strong password requirements
- [ ] Session timeout configured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced in production
- [ ] Security headers implemented
- [ ] Regular security updates

## 🚨 Security Best Practices

### **Never Do This:**
- ❌ Commit `.env` files to Git
- ❌ Use default/weak passwords
- ❌ Share AWS credentials
- ❌ Run with root/admin privileges
- ❌ Expose internal IPs publicly

### **Always Do This:**
- ✅ Use environment variables for secrets
- ✅ Implement strong authentication
- ✅ Regular security audits
- ✅ Monitor access logs
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated

## 🔐 Authentication Security

### **Password Requirements:**
- Minimum 8 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- No common passwords
- Regular password rotation

### **Session Security:**
- 24-hour session timeout
- Secure session storage
- HTTPS-only cookies
- CSRF protection

## 🛡️ Data Protection

### **S3 Security:**
- Bucket policies restrict access
- Encryption at rest enabled
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS)
- Access logging enabled
- Versioning for critical data

### **User Data:**
- Passwords hashed with SHA-256
- Personal data encrypted
- Regular data backups
- Data retention policies

## 📋 Security Monitoring

### **Logs to Monitor:**
- Authentication attempts
- File upload activities
- API access patterns
- Error rates
- Performance metrics

### **Alerts to Set:**
- Failed login attempts
- Unusual file uploads
- API rate limit violations
- S3 access anomalies
- System resource usage

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### **Server Security:**
